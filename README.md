Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.The goal of EDA is to understand what the data is telling us before conducting more formal statistical analyses and based on that building predictive models by training the model.
Car Price Prediction model is based on Exploratory Data Analysis where 1st the required libraries were imported and CSV file was imported , data overview was done EDA helps in understanding the structure of the dataset, including its size, shape, types of variables, and missing values after that data was cleaned in order to visualise it in better way ( EDA can reveal inconsistencies or anomalies in the data that may require cleaning or preprocessing, such as handling missing values, outliers, or erroneous entries).
Then data was visualised by visualizing data through histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc., EDA helps in identifying patterns, trends, outliers, and relationships between variables. Bivariate Analysis was performed  to explore relationships between pairs of variables to understand correlations, associations, or dependencies.
Use scatter plots, correlation matrices, heat maps, or grouped summaries to visualize relationships, also feauture engineering was done to get the better analysis.
